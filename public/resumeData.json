		"bio": "I’m Sai Prashanthi Varakala, M.B.B.S., a physician trained at Osmania Medical College, India, with diverse clinical experience across India and the United States. My journey in medicine has taken me from caring for patients in rural India as a Duty Medical Officer to gaining hands-on experience in U.S. hospitals such as AdventHealth, HCA Houston Healthcare, Centinela Hospital, and West Anaheim Medical Center. I’ve cultivated a strong foundation in evidence-based internal medicine, clinical reasoning, and compassionate care. Beyond the wards, I serve as a Quality Improvement Lead and Tele-Primary Care Physician at Sanjeevani E-Clinic, where I work to expand access to affordable healthcare in underserved communities. My academic curiosity extends to research, with peer-reviewed publications in Cureus and Fortune Journals on topics ranging from artificial intelligence in multimorbidity to health disparities in diabetes. Creativity keeps me balanced — whether through sketching, photography, or community engagement as a CPR trainer and medical conference organizer. My goal is to blend clinical skill with empathy, using every patient interaction as an opportunity to learn, heal, and lead with purpose.",
